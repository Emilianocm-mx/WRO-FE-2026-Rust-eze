## ⚙️ Mechanical Process

Our mechanical design focuses on stability, and precise maneuverability to tackle the high-speed requirements of the WRO Future Engineers challenges. The entire robot was designed from scratch using CAD software and manufactured via 3D printing. We used SolidWorks as our CAD software:

<img width="1280" height="684" alt="assy" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9cb5212f-5ba9-4bf2-8bcd-9cad8fd39e7b" />

### 1. Chassis & Weight Distribution
* **Material:** Printed in PLA/PETG for a great balance between rigidity and lightweight performance.
* **Low Center of Gravity:** Heavier components, such as the LiPo battery and the Pololu motor, are mounted as low as possible to prevent the robot from tipping over during sharp corners.
* **Modular Design:** The chassis is divided into easily replaceable sections (front steering assembly, main body, and rear drivetrain) to allow quick repairs during competition days. Also, our CAD desing is basically 2 pieces that consist of a top_cover and main_chassis with each mechanisism working independently.

| Top | Chassis |

### 2. Steering System (Ackermann Geometry)
We used to have a simple paralel steering in our robot, but as we continued with our tests it was clear that the addition of a different type of steering was necessary. To ensure smooth cornering and minimize tire scrubbing, we implemented an **Ackermann steering mechanism** which is the same type that comercial cars use.
* Actuated by the **MG90 Micro Servo** and a steering system assembled with 3 M2 screws ensure that our ackermann the type steering can work efficiently at all times.
* This geometry is critical for maintaining traction and speed while navigating the tight turns of the challenge in general.

### 3. Drivetrain & Transmission
* **Rear-Wheel Drive (RWD):** Driven by a single **N20 Pololu 300 RPM DC Motor**. While it was not the fist motor we used, the different design itterations helped us find the perfect motor to power out robot. 
* **Power Transfer:** We designed a custom structure with bearings in order to use the lego differential (pieces 65413 and 65414) connecting the motor to the solid rear axle. Originally, the power transfer depended on two single gears of lego (32269 and 32270 being the second one the driver gear), however, this meant a lack of smooth cornering which led us to our new configuration. Our gear ratio was calculated to provide the perfect balance between top speed on the straightaways and high torque for the Obstacle Challenge maneuvers (like parallel parking or the obstacle avoidance). Finally, the design continued to be a mix of 3D printed parts with lego pieces due to the risks that a 3D printed one could have, and since we did not consider necessary to print in stronger materials (like abs or nylon) the legos were a perfect solution to us.

##Transmission & Gear Ratio

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Driver gear | 12T |
| Driven gear | 28T |
| **Total Gear Ratio** | **2.33:1** |

For every full rotation of the motor shaft, the differential input rotates 0.43 times. The LEGO new-generation differential distributes torque between both rear wheels with a 1:1 ratio in straight-line motion. During turns, it allows the wheels to rotate at different speeds independently, eliminating tire scrubbing.

** Our torque & performance choices**
* **Mechanical Advantage:** The 2.33:1 gear reduction via the LEGO differential provides adequate torque multiplication for the robot's weight, especially after removing the RPi and powerbank.
* **Overvolting for Performance:** Operating the N20 at 7.4V instead of its 6V nominal rating provides a ~23% increase in both RPM and torque, which compensates for drivetrain friction losses.
* **Electrical Safety:** The TB6612FNG driver operates well within its safe limits with the N20 motor at 7.4V.
* **Weight Optimization:** Migrating from RPi + powerbank to a standalone ESP32 system is estimated to reduce robot weight by 200–250g, improving torque margin from tight to comfortable.

### 4. Sensor Integration
* **RPLiDAR Tower:** Elevated and centrally mounted to guarantee a 360° unobstructed field of view, preventing any chassis parts from creating blind spots. It is mounted with M2.5 screws with perfectly designed holes in the cassis. It was hard to land with a design that could allow us to fit the electronics without compromising our lidar. Fortunately, the design choice of having to modular pieces was a perfect way of attacking this problem without the appearance of further problems regarding this.
* **Camera Mount:** The ESP32-CAM is mounted in front of the robot with a simple slot on the cassis so that it can still be taken out easily without compromising stability. We consider this a perfect example of our design choices, since we did not had to create a whole assembly in order to mount the camera in the chassis.

### 🔄 Design Iterations

| Version | Focus Area | Key Improvements |
|---------|------------|------------------|
| **V1.0** | Functionality and weight reduce | Since we used to depend on a RPI and a PWR BANK, the chassis needed to be light and sturdy in order hold up with the weight of this components. |
| **V2.0** | Steering Optimization | Implemented Ackermann geometry, with a MG90 servo in order to provide more torque for our robot. |
| **V3.0** | Final Frame | We changed to lighter components (XIAO C6 and LiPo battery) so our final chassis ended up being more sturdy and easy to assemble then at the beggining. |

### 🔋 Power Budget

The entire vehicle is powered by a 7.4V 800mAh 2S LiPo battery. Power splits into two primary pathways following the main toggle switch (U1): the motor driver takes the 7.4V battery voltage directly to power the DC motor (VM pin), while the rest of the system is fed through an LM2596 step-down converter producing a stable 5V supply at up to 3A.

| Rail | Voltage | Consumers | Estimated Peak Current |
|:---|:---:|:---|:---:|
| Main Power Rail | 7.4V (2S LiPo) | Total system power distribution through Switch (U1) | ~1.85 A |
| 5V Regulated Rail | 5V | LM2596 Converter output -> XIAO ESP32-C6, ESP32-CAM, RPLiDAR A1M8, MG90 Micro Servo, TB6612FNG (VCC logic) | ~1.30 A |
| 7.4V Motor Rail | 7.4V | TB6612FNG Driver (VM) -> Pololu DC Motor (N20) | ~0.50 A |
| 3.3V Logic Rail | 3.3V | GY-BMI160 (IMU) & Push-Button (fed via XIAO ESP32-C6 internal 3.3V regulator) | ~50 mA |

### Battery Selection & Justification

* **Voltage Compatibility:** The 7.4V (2S LiPo) nominal voltage provides optimal operating voltage for the Pololu DC motor without needing a boost converter, while offering enough voltage overhead for the LM2596 buck converter to cleanly step down to 5V.
* **Separation of Power Paths:** Feeding 7.4V directly to the TB6612FNG motor driver (VM) isolates motor stall-current spikes and noise from the 5V logic rail. This prevents brownouts and reboots on the XIAO ESP32-C6, ESP32-CAM, and RPLiDAR A1M8 during sudden motor acceleration.
* **Discharge Headroom:** Standard 800mAh 2S LiPo batteries feature continuous discharge ratings of at least 20C (16 A continuous output). With a total system peak draw of ~1.85 A, the vehicle draws under 12% of the battery's maximum discharge capability, protecting the cells from overheating and voltage drop.
* **Weight & Operating Time:** At a typical average draw of 600–800 mA during autonomous navigation, the 800mAh capacity provides around 45 to 60 minutes of runtime while maintaining a low overall vehicle mass.

## 💻 Source Code

The main program runs on the **XIAO ESP32-C6**, which processes RPLiDAR distance data in real time, fuses it with IMU heading data, and controls both the steering servo and drive motor through a hybrid PID + yaw control system.

We would like to include more images but since the lidar does not map due to the way our code works the only images that we can provide come from the esp-cam.

### System Capabilities

- Reads 360° distance data from the RPLiDAR A1M8 via UART, sampling specific angles as named rays (0°, 60°, 90°, 120°, 170°, 180°, 190°, 240°, 270°, 300°, 340°, 20°)
- Integrates gyroscope data from the BMI160 at 100 Hz to track heading (yaw) with automatic bias calibration at startup
- Runs a **hybrid steering controller**: IMU-based yaw control as primary, with LiDAR wall-following as fallback when IMU is invalid
- Maintains a dynamic wall distance setpoint that is captured fresh after each corner, adapting to each corridor without forcing a fixed target
- Detects corners using a multi-condition state machine: front wall blocked + back clear + lateral opening confirmed + opposite wall closed
- Counts completed corners and laps, stopping the motor autonomously after 3 laps (12 corners total)
- Applies **IMU drift correction** continuously during straight sections by comparing wall angle against integrated yaw
- Receives red/green pillar color data from ESP32-CAM via UART with CRC-validated framing (Obstacle Challenge)
- Implements a **two-device start protocol**: the robot waits for a button press signal from the ESP32-CAM before enabling motion, satisfying WRO's one-button start rule without a physical button on the main controller

### 🏁 Open Challenge

The Open Challenge uses the RPLiDAR as the primary perception source and the BMI160 as the heading reference. No camera input is used.

**Startup sequence:**
The robot initializes the BMI160, collects 500 gyroscope samples to compute a Z-axis bias offset, then starts the LiDAR and waits for the start signal from the ESP32-CAM button. Once received, it waits 500 ms before enabling motion, giving the LiDAR rotor time to reach full speed and the IMU reference to settle.

**First corridor:**
Before the first corner is completed, `trackDir` is `UNKNOWN`. The robot reads two diagonal rays on each side (60°/120° for right, 300°/240° for left) and selects whichever wall is closer as its reference. It then follows that wall at the measured distance, using parallelism between the front and back rays to stay aligned. A soft-escape maneuver activates if the robot starts too close to a wall, gently steering away until a safe clearance is reached.

**Straight-line control:**
Once a reference wall is selected, the steering loop runs every 20 ms. It computes a desired yaw correction from the wall distance error, rate-limits the setpoint change to avoid sharp inputs, then feeds it into a yaw P+D controller using the IMU. The derivative term damps oscillation using the live gyroscope rate rather than a numerical derivative. While the IMU is valid, this loop runs as primary. If the IMU fails or loses calibration, the system falls back to a pure LiDAR PID on the wall rays directly.

**Drift correction:**
On every straight section, the system compares the geometric angle of the tracked wall (computed from the two diagonal rays) against the IMU's relative yaw. If they differ consistently, a slow integrating correction is applied to `yawOffset`, keeping the IMU reference aligned with reality over time without introducing sudden jumps.

**Corner detection:**
A corner is triggered when all of the following are true simultaneously: a front wall is detected below 1200 mm, the back is clear beyond 1500 mm, the lateral opening on the turn side has been continuously open for at least 100 ms after previously seeing a wall, and the opposite wall confirms a corridor is closed. This multi-condition approach prevents false triggers from partial LiDAR returns or transient reflections.

**Turn execution:**
When a corner is confirmed, the servo goes to full lock and the IMU target is updated by ±90°. The turn completes when the IMU error falls within 4° and the angular rate drops below 35°/s for 60 ms. A 1400 ms timeout serves as a safety fallback. After the turn, the wall distance setpoint is re-captured from the new corridor's diagonal rays, and all PID state (integral, error smoother) is reset to avoid impulse artifacts.

**Lap completion:**
After 12 corners (3 laps × 4 corners), the robot enters `FINAL_APPROACH` state, drives forward for a calibrated time window (currently 800 ms), then cuts the motor and centers the servo, stopping autonomously in the finish section.

### 🚧 Obstacle Challenge

🚧 Obstacle Challenge
The Obstacle Challenge software relies on a tightly coupled sensor fusion architecture running on the XIAO ESP32-C6. Rather than executing hardcoded routines, the robot operates on a reactive state machine that dynamically calculates trajectories based on real-time LiDAR point clouds, IMU gyroscope integration, and ESP32-CAM visual data.

| Red obstacle | Green obstacle |
|:---:|:---:|
| <div align="center"><img src="07_appendix/obstacle_red.jpeg" width="550" height="550"></div> | <div align="center"><img src="07_appendix/obstacle_green.jpeg" width="550" height="550"></div> |

**Vision-to-LiDAR Spatial Mapping:** The ESP32-CAM processes frames and transmits color (Red/Green) and bounding box data via a CRC16-validated UART protocol. Because a 2D camera cannot measure depth accurately, the C6 calculates the visual bearing of the bounding box (imageAngle) and feeds it into the findPillar() function. This function scans the 360° RPLiDAR array at that specific angle to extract the exact physical distance and width of the pillar.

**Dynamic Evasion (maneuverHeading & adaptPassToWall):** Once a pillar is mapped, the robot determines the passing side (Red = right, Green = left). It calculates a plannedOffset by measuring the available space between the pillar and the lane walls (laneWallDistance). The maneuverHeading function then generates a target yaw angle to steer the robot smoothly around the obstacle without hitting the perimeter walls.

**Corner Detection & Reversing Maneuvers:** Instead of relying on a single distance threshold, fitCornerWall() uses a mathematical line-fitting algorithm to analyze multiple LiDAR points and confirm a flat wall is ahead. Combined with sampleCornerEvidence()—which verifies the front is blocked, the right is open, and the left is closed—the robot initiates a precise IMU-guided turn (REVERSING_TURN), applying reverse motor thrust if clearance (FRONT_CHASSIS_GAP_MM) drops too low.

**State Machine & Fault Recovery (serviceRecovery)**: The robot cycles through states like MOVING, PARALLEL, and CENTERING. If sensor data drops (e.g., LiDAR UART lag or missing camera frames), the robot instantly enters a RECOVERING state, cutting motor power (ESPERA_DATOS) until stable readings return, preventing blind crashes.

Development Evolution & Our Technical Challenges

**Camera Processing Latency:** Early versions of the code suffered from "ghost pillars." By the time the ESP32-CAM finished processing a frame and sent it to the C6, the robot had already moved and rotated, making the camera's angle data obsolete. We solved this by recording the IMU's exact heading (photoYaw) the millisecond a photo is requested, allowing the C6 to mathematically offset the camera's bearing by the exact amount the robot turned during the processing delay.

**LiDAR Noise and False Corners:** The RPLiDAR (Or at least our model - A1M8) occasionally returns fragmented points or is unnable to detect the walls after certain distances do to the black matte color we chose as painting, triggering false corners or simply not giving back any data. We evolved the code from basic distance thresholds to the current CornerEvidence system, which requires simultaneous confirmation of a solid front wall (via line-fitting), an open side passage, and an opposite solid wall before committing to a turn.

**Serial Communication Bottlenecks:** Managing two high-speed UART streams (LiDAR at 115200 baud, Camera at 38400 baud) alongside I2C IMU reads caused buffer overflows and corrupted packets. We implemented a custom LidarStreamReader ring buffer and strict CRC16 checksums for the camera, allowing the system to instantly discard corrupted bytes without crashing the main loop.
